#Bioacoustics 101


##Course Description

This is a biology undergraduate student oriented course.


##Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to:

1. Explain how animals produce, modify, detect and analyze sound to communicate using acoustic signals.
2. Select and use the proper equipment to capture and record acoustic signals.
3. Perform a sound spectrogram analysis to investigate the recorded acoustic signals.
4. Develop a research project about animal acoustic signaling.
